  I made this piece as an assignment during my freehand drawing class. 
  From doing this piece I learned that there are many scales when it comes one color.

    To draw this I had to learn about human anatomy and how the body looks in different angles. 
    To practice drawing the human body we were given 30 seconds to quickly draw a human body doing an expressive pose.
   the point of the exersize was to focus on the bodys form and expression of movemnt since if those are not factored 
   in the whole drawing can come across as stiff.

  For this project we had to learn about different figures and how they refreflect to light and how it looks 
   like when they have shadding.
